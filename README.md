GHC Agenda

I needed a better visualization of the agenda for GHC 2020, so I used this to learn to web scrape and use the Google Calendar API.
I scraped the data from the vGHC agenda site. This repo contains the agenda stored as CSV files for each day. 
I also used Google Calendar API to create Google Calendar events for each session.
